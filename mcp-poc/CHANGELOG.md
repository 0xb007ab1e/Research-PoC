- Detailed troubleshooting guide for JWT and mTLS issues
- Service-specific documentation for each component
- Make targets for local development and testing

#### üß™ Testing & Quality
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Security scanning with automated tools
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Code quality checks with linting and formatting
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning

### Technical Specifications

#### Service Architecture
- **Auth Service**: Go 1.21+, Gin HTTP framework, Vault client
- **Context Service**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, asyncpg, SQLAlchemy
- **Text Summarization**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, sentence-transformers, torch

#### Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with tenant-specific schemas
- **Secret Management**: HashiCorp Vault with Transit secrets engine
- **Caching**: Redis 7+ for session and application caching
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds and distroless images

#### API Endpoints

**Auth Service (Port 8443)**:
- `GET /authorize` - OAuth2.1 authorization endpoint
- `POST /token` - Token exchange endpoint
- `GET /.well-known/jwks.json` - JSON Web Key Set
- `POST /introspect` - Token introspection
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

**Context Service (Port 8001)**:
- `POST /context` - Create context data
- `GET /context/{id}` - Retrieve context by ID
- `PUT /context/{id}` - Update context data
- `GET /healthz` - Health check with dependency status
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

**Text Summarization Service (Port 8000)**:
- `POST /v1/summarize` - Generate text summary
- `GET /healthz` - Health check with model status
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables
- Complete environment-based configuration for all services
- Development defaults with production-ready options
- Secret management via environment variables and Vault
- Configurable security settings (TLS, mTLS, rate limiting)

#### Local Development
- One-command setup: `make local-run`
- Hot-reload for all services during development
- Automatic dependency startup and health checking
- Individual service run targets for focused development

### Security Considerations

#### Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth2.1 with mandatory PKCE for enhanced security
- JWT tokens with cryptographic signing via Vault
- Automatic key rotation with 24-hour intervals
- Tenant-aware access control and data isolation

#### Transport Security
- Optional TLS 1.3/1.2 encryption for all endpoints
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) support for service-to-service communication
- Configurable cipher suites and certificate validation

#### Container Security
- Distroless base images with minimal attack surface
- Non-root user execution (UID 1000)
- Read-only root filesystems
- Dropped capabilities and no privilege escalation

### Known Limitations

- Development-mode Vault (data not persisted)
- In-memory rate limiting (Redis integration planned)
- Single-node deployment (clustering support planned)
- Limited AI model selection (additional models planned)

### Migration Notes

This is the initial release. Future versions will include:
- Database migration scripts for schema updates
- Configuration migration guides
- Service upgrade procedures

### Contributors

Initial development and MVP implementation completed as part of the MCP Platform project.
