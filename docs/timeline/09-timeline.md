## Critical Path Dependencies

### Phase 1: Foundations (5 weeks)
- Requirements → Architecture (sequential)
- Architecture completion gates all Build phase work

### Phase 2: Build (5 weeks parallel)
- API Core & Routing can start after Architecture
- ML Context Service can start after Architecture  
- IaC & CI/CD starts after API Core foundation is laid

### Phase 3: Hardening (3 weeks)
- Security & Pen-test requires all Build components complete
- Critical blocker for any Launch activities

### Phase 4: Launch (3 weeks)
- Beta Tenants depends on Security clearance
- GA Release depends on Beta feedback integration

## Resource Allocation

| Phase | Team Members | Key Roles |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Foundations | 4 | Product Manager, Solutions Architect, 2 Senior Engineers |
| Build | 8 | Backend Team Lead, ML Engineering Lead, DevOps Lead, 5 Engineers |
| Hardening | 3 | Security Engineer, QA Lead, 1 Engineer |
| Launch | 6 | Product Manager, Customer Success Manager, Support Lead, 3 Engineers |
